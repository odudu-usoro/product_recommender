Line-by-Line Explanation:

import numpy as np:
    Imports NumPy, a library for numerical operations in Python, often used for handling arrays.

def batch_data(X, y, batch_size)::
    Defines the batch_data function, which takes in feature data X, target data y, and a batch_size parameter.

for i in range(0, len(X), batch_size)::
    Loops through the data in increments of batch_size, which allows for splitting the data into smaller, manageable batches.

X_batch = X.iloc[i:i + batch_size]:
    Slices the feature data X to create a batch starting from index i to i + batch_size.

y_batch = y.iloc[i:i + batch_size]:
    Slices the target data y similarly to create the corresponding batch.

yield X_batch, y_batch:
    Yields the feature and target batches as a tuple, allowing the function to return each batch one by one in an iterative manner.

if __name__ == "__main__"::
    Checks if this script is being run as the main program. If true, the following code block will execute.

from preprocess import preprocess_data:
    Imports the preprocess_data function from preprocess.py.

X_train, X_val, X_test, y_train, y_val, y_test = preprocess_data():
    Calls the preprocess_data function to retrieve the preprocessed datasets.

batch_size = 64:
    Defines the batch size for data processing.

train_batches = list(batch_data(X_train, y_train, batch_size)):
    Calls the batch_data function to generate batches for the training data, then converts the result to a list.

val_batches = list(batch_data(X_val, y_val, batch_size)):
    Generates and stores the validation data batches in a list.

test_batches = list(batch_data(X_test, y_test, batch_size)):
    Generates and stores the test data batches in a list.
