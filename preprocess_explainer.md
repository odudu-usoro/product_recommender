Line-by-Line Explanation:

import pandas as pd:
    Imports the pandas library, which provides data structures and data analysis tools, particularly for dataframes, which are 2D labeled data structures.

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split:
    Imports the train_test_split function from scikit-learn, a tool used to split data into training and testing sets.

from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder:
    Imports the LabelEncoder class from scikit-learn, which is used to convert categorical labels into numerical values.

def preprocess_data()::
    Defines the preprocess_data function, which will handle data preprocessing tasks.

df = pd.read_csv('amazon.csv'):
    Reads the amazon.csv file into a pandas DataFrame named df. The DataFrame will hold the dataset in a tabular form.

df['rating'] = pd.to_numeric(df['rating'], errors='coerce'):
    Converts the rating column to a numeric type. If any value cannot be converted, it is replaced with NaN (Not a Number).

df = df.dropna(subset=['rating', 'user_id', 'product_id']):
    Removes rows with missing values (NaN) in the rating, user_id, or product_id columns.

df = df.drop_duplicates():
    Removes duplicate rows from the DataFrame to ensure that each entry is unique.

user_encoder = LabelEncoder():
    Creates an instance of the LabelEncoder for encoding the user_id column into numerical values.

item_encoder = LabelEncoder():
    Creates another instance of the LabelEncoder for encoding the product_id column into numerical values.

df['user_id'] = user_encoder.fit_transform(df['user_id']):
    Fits the user_encoder to the user_id column and transforms it into a sequence of integers.

df['product_id'] = item_encoder.fit_transform(df['product_id']):
    Fits the item_encoder to the product_id column and transforms it into a sequence of integers.

X = df[['user_id', 'product_id']]:
    Creates the feature matrix X by selecting the user_id and product_id columns.

y = df['rating']:
    Creates the target vector y, which contains the rating values.

X_train, X_temp, y_train, y_temp = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42):
    Splits the data into training and temporary sets, with 80% of the data used for training and 20% reserved for validation/testing. The random_state=42 ensures that the split is reproducible.

X_val, X_test, y_val, y_test = train_test_split(X_temp, y_temp, test_size=0.5, random_state=42):
    Further splits the temporary set into validation and test sets, each with 10% of the original dataset.

return X_train, X_val, X_test, y_train, y_val, y_test:
    Returns the training, validation, and test sets.

if __name__ == "__main__"::
    Checks if this script is being run as the main program. If true, the following code block will execute.

X_train, X_val, X_test, y_train, y_val, y_test = preprocess_data():
    Calls the preprocess_data function and assigns its output to variables.
