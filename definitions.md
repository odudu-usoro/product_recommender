Parameters:

num_users: The number of unique users in the dataset.
num_items: The number of unique items in the dataset.
embedding_dim: The dimension of the embedding vectors used to represent users and items.
learning_rate: The learning rate for the gradient descent optimization.
Embedding Initialization:

self.user_embedding: A matrix of shape (num_users, embedding_dim) initialized randomly. Each row corresponds to the embedding vector for a user.
self.item_embedding: A matrix of shape (num_items, embedding_dim) initialized randomly. Each row corresponds to the embedding vector for an item.
Weights Initialization:

self.weights: A linear layer (a weight matrix) initialized with random values, which has a shape of (2 * embedding_dim, 1). This weight matrix is responsible for combining user and item embeddings for predictions. The reason it's 2 * embedding_dim is that user and item embeddings are concatenated before the prediction.
self.bias: A scalar value initialized to 0.0, used in the linear layer to shift the predictions.
