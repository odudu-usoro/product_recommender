Line-by-Line Explanation:

from data.preprocess import preprocess_data:
    Imports the preprocess_data function from preprocess.py.

from data.dataloader import batch_data:
    Imports the batch_data function from dataloader.py.

def main()::
    Defines the main function, which will be the entry point of the program.

X_train, X_val, X_test, y_train, y_val, y_test = preprocess_data():
    Calls the preprocess_data function to obtain the preprocessed datasets.

batch_size = 64:
    Defines the batch size for data processing.

train_batches = list(batch_data(X_train, y_train, batch_size)):
    Generates batches for the training data and stores them in a list.

val_batches = list(batch_data(X_val, y_val, batch_size)):
    Generates and stores the validation data batches.

test_batches = list(batch_data(X_test, y_test, batch_size)):
    Generates and stores the test data batches.

for X_batch, y_batch in train_batches:
    Iterates over the batches of training data.

# Implement your training loop here:
    Placeholder comment indicating where the training loop should be implemented.

if __name__ == "__main__"::
    Checks if this script is being run as the main program. If true, the following code block will execute.

main():
    Calls the main function, initiating the workflow.

Summary:
preprocess.py: Handles loading, cleaning, encoding, and splitting the dataset.

dataloader.py: Implements a simple function to batch the dataset for further processing.

main.py: Orchestrates the entire process, calling the functions defined in the other files and preparing the data for model training.
