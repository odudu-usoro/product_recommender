Certainly! I can guide you through installing PyTorch on your WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) Ubuntu environment. Here's a step-by-step process:

1. First, make sure your WSL Ubuntu is up to date:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

2. Install Python3 and pip if you haven't already:

```bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
```

3. It's recommended to use a virtual environment for your project. If you don't have virtualenv installed, you can install it with:

```bash
sudo pip3 install virtualenv
```

4. Create and activate a virtual environment for your project:

```bash
python3 -m venv ancf_env
source ancf_env/bin/activate
```

5. Now, you're ready to install PyTorch. The exact command depends on whether you have CUDA-capable GPU. Since you're using WSL, it's likely you don't have GPU support, so we'll install the CPU-only version. Run this command:

```bash
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```

6. Verify the installation:

```bash
python3 -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"
```

This should print the PyTorch version without any errors.

7. Install other necessary packages for your project:

```bash
pip3 install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib optuna
```

Now you have PyTorch and all the necessary dependencies installed in your WSL Ubuntu environment.

Remember to activate your virtual environment (`source ancf_env/bin/activate`) whenever you work on your project.
